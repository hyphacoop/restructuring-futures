## Run locally

If you have python installed, you can run it locally by using the following command:

> Check if Python is installed  

> Open your command prompt (Windows) / terminal (macOS/ Linux). To check if Python is installed, enter the following command:  


`python -V`  

> If the above fails, try:

`python3 -V`  

> Or, if the "py" command is available, try:  

`py -V`


> If Python version returned above is 3.X
> On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server"  

`python3 -m http.server`  

> If Python version returned above is 2.X  

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

If you run into difficulties or need to install Python, check out this [web page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) for instructions on how to set-up a local testing server.
